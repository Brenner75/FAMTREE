He was the "dashing Wiedner Schaani", who married at the age of 22, but caused his *109*wife* a lot of grief with his women's stories. 
Of his 3 sons, only *54*Albrecht*, the middle one, survived. 
<br><br>When his *r109*wife* was already ill, he already started dancing with a *r1982*a fashion lady.* 
He married her shortly afterwards, but was not faithful to her either, but fled to Romania.
<br><br>He was brought back by his brother-in-law, Mr. Ponfikel, and taken to the Imperial Northern Railway. He and his family moved 
then from Moedling to Duernkrut and lived for rent in a beautiful house of a Jewish businessman. 
<br><br>On 19.6.1898 they bought the house in German-Wagram (today's street front) from a Hofer family for 2550 guilders and took a 
mortgage of 2000 guilders, which could only be repaid by her granddaughter.
<br><br>In his old age he had a very good marriage, went to church on Sundays with his *r1982*wife* hooked up and told his *r27*granddaughter*
 - who often and gladly came to visit - beautiful fairy tales.  On Saturdays, the jewelry was cleaned - an almost sacred act for him. He brewed his own beer and wine and played the Werkel or Ariston.
<br><br>Unfortunately, he did not have a good relationship with his only son *r54*Albrecht*, because he did not agree with the choice of his *r55*wife*.
