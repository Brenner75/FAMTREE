Hans, called 'Hiderl', followed the family tradition and learned the waiter's trade in England. There he was not only able to learn 
English language skills and excellent manners, but also found his wife Jessy, a Londoner by birth.
Somehow he ended up on the island of Brioni, where he later also gave his brother Josef a post to run the civil servants' canteen. 
Although he was the longest survivor of the 'Binder Children', little is known about his later life.
