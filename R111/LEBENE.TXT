She and her sister *r1921*Mina* were orphans and had to register immediately as a 
maids. They were so badly fed by a Mayer family in Vienna that they went away and left a note: 
"The peas and lentils drove us away, otherwise we would have stayed longer at Mayer's."
<br><br>Unlike her *r1921* sister* who went to Holy Mass every day, she had the attitude: "I am not doing anything wrong and God is everywhere!"
<br><br>She met her *r110*husband* - a pay waiter - in Vienna and immediately had an illegitimate *r55*child* from him. Only a year later 
they married in St. Stefan in Baden near Vienna and had little *r55*Emilie* registered in the marriage. After that, the family moved to Baden and 
leased the community inn in Leesdorf. When she was 36, her *r110*husband* died and she was left alone with 6 children. She had her eldest 
*r55*Daughter* from school at the age of 11 so that she could help her raise the lively brothers. The boys were probably 
real bullies and she often had to pay for damage to smashed windows - often with a calming crumb or quarter in the inn 
to the Sandwirt, which she ran at that time. At that time there was no curfew and she often had to stay with a drunk guest until the 
early morning hours. 
<br><br>For the sake of the children, she remained unmarried, although she had received many requests from guests.
Unfortunately, she was not thanked for this, because when she handed over the business to her eldest son *r1904*Pepi*, she was thrown out oft he house by her *r1908*daughter-in-law*
 and had to move from one child to another in her old age, wherever she was needed. This was with her daughter *r1905*Johanna*
 the case, who lived with her *r1911*husband* and 5 children in Martonvasar in Hungary on the farm of Anton Drechsler, where her *r1905*husband* was stable master 
for over 80 horses and 10 carriages.
<br><br>Often she had enough of this life and traveled - completely without luggage and spontaneously - to her *r27*grandchild* in German-Wagram.
