Together with her older *r1816*sister* she was raised by her grandparents in +oDEUTSCH+German-Wagram+, while her parents lived in +oADERKLA+Aderklaa+, for the following 2 reasons.
If the large house in +oDEUTSCH+German-Wagram+ had only been inhabited by 2 people, then people would certainly have been forcibly quartered there, as there were many 
homeless families.
Secondly, she would have had to go to school in Aderklaa with her own *r26*father* and they wanted to avoid the need to explain that the A's in the report card were a gift from the *r26*father*. 
The grandparents had strict discipline, especially punctuality. Once the "stupid children" even wanted to run away.
<br><br>As a young girl she often had to buy from a butcher who had a large St. Bernard dog on a chain, of which she was very afraid. And indeed, 
one day the dog broke free, pursued her, and would have torn her to pieces if the master of the house had not intervened. The resulting fear of dogs still lives on today 
some of their *r6*descendants*.
<br><br>In contrast to her *r1816*sister*, who was allowed to go to the teacher training academy, in her time the need was so great and the money so scarce that she worked with her *r54*grandfather* at the post office 
had to be accommodated.
<br><br>When her *r1816*sister* found a dashing *r12*piano player* in the fraternity, however, she won the race and married the *r12*"bald man"* shortly afterwards.
The family then moved with the *r1801*daughter* born in 1938 to +oHAINFEL+Hainfeld+ in a beautiful $s 000$Villa$. Then the Second World War broke out and she had to go on with the *r1801*child* 
adventurous way to flee from the imminent invasion of the Russians towards the end of the war to Lower Bavaria, where her *r1816*sister* was married.
<br><br>Her *r12*husband*, who was in Russian captivity, returned in 1946 and the family was happily reunited in +oDEUTSCH+German-Wagram+ in the house of her parents and grandparents, 
where they lived until 1954.
<br><br>With the unexpected *r6*latecomer* born in 1949, she and the family then moved to +oWIEN+Wien+, where she lived briefly in a rented apartment of her sister. In your first own flat 
in +oWIEN+Wien+ Favoriten she devoted herself entirely to the management of an upper middle class household with everything that went with it. 
<br><br>After her two children left home (first her *r1801*daughter* who went to America, and later her *r6*son* who emigrated to England), she and her *r12*husband* were always drawn to the house 
more to +oDEUTSCH+German-Wagram+, where the house was empty after the death of her *r27*mother*.
There she was very involved in a religious association - the Cursillo. Some of her $s$010 thoughts$ from that time are still preserved in writing.
<br><br>After the death of her *r12*husband* she became very enterprising and undertook many long-distance trips with her *r1801*daughter* to China, India, Russia, etc.
<br><br>When her mental strength waned, she moved into a retirement home near Schoenbrunn, where she spent several years in top physical shape until her peaceful death.
