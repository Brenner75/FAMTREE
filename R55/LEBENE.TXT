Emilie was the oldest child and had to raise her four lively brothers after the early death of her *r110*father*, while her sister had lung disease 
and had also died early. The coffin was transported on a carriage and Emilie was allowed to sit on the carriage box, which she liked very much. 
<br><br>Otherwise her
youth was not nice - she had to wash laundry in the icy stream, and often defend her little brothers on the long way to school sometimes with the leather strap of their school bags.
She was robbed while shopping for the inn ("go little one, I'll hold your sausage basket while you get me cigarettes") 
and had to go to the ball as the only girl with a gray dress, where everyone else wore white. 
Once she wanted to make her *r111*mother* happy and pick her up from the train station in Baden - but to do so she had to put all her brothers in one pram and received a severe  beating from her mother.
<br><br>She also had to work as a waitress in the inn of the *r111*mother* in Baden, where the students often got credit from her thanks to her kindness. 
There she met her admirer *r1955*Karl Dorrek*, but she did not give in to him (but he later adopted her granddaughter *r1916*Hertha*)  but favoured her future husband *r54*Albrecht*.
<br><br>She was a kind-hearted soul and cared for everyone and everyone. She even visited her brother *r1904*Pepi* who had taken over the inn from the *r111*mother*,  every week in the mountain retreat on the Schoepfel mountain (which he had taken over) and brought him beef filet and cream  for his guests. 
When her *r111*mother* died, she sent a telegram to all the brothers with the wording: "*r111*mother* dead, me too".
<br><br>As a young woman, she was treated like a servant by her domineering *1982*step-mother-in-law*, but never complained about it and begged 
even her resolute *r27*daughter*, who often defended her: "Don't say anything about it!".
<br><br>After the death of her beloved *r54*Albrecht* she lived in the same household in Deutsch-Wagram and was mainly responsible for the daily "boiling" of the 
milk. 
She also took care of the enlightenment of her *r1801*granddaughter*, but fell asleep in time as a precaution when the topics became too sensitive.
<br><br>While she was caring for her terminally ill *r26*son-in-law*, she had a dizzy spell and fell down the cellar stairs, where she wasonly  found after a few hours. She had broken her femoral neck, which was practically a death sentence at the time, 
as patients usually couldn't get back on their feet. However, her *r27*daughter* forced her to go for a long walks with the pram of her newborn *r6*grandchild* in the garden 
until she had recovered from her accident. 
<br><br>She then lived for a few more years and  had a wonderful relationship with her little *r6*lifesaver*.
