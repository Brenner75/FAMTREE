Despite the early death of her father, her mother made it possible for her and her older sister Elisabeth to attend ballet school.
She actually became a prima ballerina at the Vienna State Opera and became so rich that she occupied the entire first floor 
above the casa piccola in Vienna, Marierhilferstraﬂe.
<br>She made it possible for her youngest brother Wilhelm to study as a master builder and also helped her nephew Abrecht, 
whom she had taken under her wing. But this was tolerated by his stepmother, who could not stand those noble relatives.
<br>She granted her mother, who had raised her and her siblings under great deprivation
an annual pension of 1200 guilders, which was a small fortune at that time.
As a 45-year-old woman, she married a doctor from Paris - Dr. Flamm. Shortly before her wedding, she changed her 
will in favor of her future husband. Eight days after her marriage, she died under unexplained circumstances
in the house of her sister Anna. It was rumoured in the family that she had been poisoned by her Parisian doctor because of her money.
