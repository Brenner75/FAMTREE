On his birth certificate, his first name is written as C, but on later documents it is written as K (e.g. on his obituary it says that "Karl Brenner jun., house owner, 
on Sunday, July 4, 1920, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, was recalled to a better afterlife").
He was a dairy trader in the area of +oGAISRUC+Gaisruck+ and had a team with a blind horse, which nevertheless went its daily round independently.
Before he was admitted to the hospital for his fatal illness - a purulent middle ear infection, which then degenerated into meningitis, 
he went - according to the statement of his *r12*son* - once again through the house and yard and knew that he would never come back.
He is buried in +oSTOCKER+Stockerau+ at the new cemetery.
