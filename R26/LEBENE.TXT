Little is known about his youth, he came from a $s 000$ family of teachers$ - his *r52*father* was headmaster in +oPARBASD+Parbasdorf+ and his *r53*mother* was a handicraft teacher.
<br><br>1909 he was a substitute teacher and had to help out in 35 different schools, due to the constant travels he was more at home in inns and wine cellars than in his unheated quarters.
In Siebenbrunn he earned more by playing the organ in the church than by his teacher's salary. After church, he went to the inn, ate a goulash and drank - according to his own statement - his 30 pints of beer. 
On a journey home from a party trip (where his future father-in-law *r54*Albrecht Mock* was also present), the horse-drawn carriage overturned broke his tibia and fibula. 
A visit to his future *r27*wife* in the hospital left him so speechless that *r27*Alice* almost never wanted to see him again. However, he became engaged at Christmas 1912 and married her shortly afterwards.
At that time, he was already a teacher in Neusiedl on the Czech border. At first he didn't care much about his *r27*wife*, who was very sick and the marriage was a disaster at the beginning.
<br><br>It was only after the birth of his *r13*second daughter* that he remembered his duties as a family man. When his *r27*wife* bowled out both arms and labored on them for 12 years, he even learned to 
to set it up again - once even completely unnoticed during a concert visit in Munich.
In 1916 he was in the military, but thanks to his leg injury he managed to squat mostly in the living room. In +oNEUSIED+Neusiedl+ there was nothing left to eat after the war, so he moved with his family to the 
Parents to +oDEUTSCH+German-Wagram+.
<br><br>1919 he then received a permanent position as a teacher in +oADERKLA+Aderklaa+. He was involved as an organist, community secretary, $s 040$insurance agent$ and probably also a bit with the emerging $s 010$Nazi Party$.
<br><br>In 1942 the school in +oADERKLA+Aderklaa+ was closed due to a lack of children and he was forced to move with his family back to his parents in +oDEUTSCH+Wagram+. In 1945 he was drafted into the Volkssturm.
After the war, there was great famine - he leased a field in Strasshof, where he grew vegetables, but they were stolen before the harvest. He imported geese from Poland, which his *r55*mother-in-law* bought, 
tried his hand at chicken-rabbit and beekeeping -but not always successfully! Since he was considered Nazi sypathiser he did not receive a pension. 
<br><br>Times were very hard.
At the end of the 40s, he increasingly lost $s 020$weight$, his schoolmates no longer recognized him at a graduation ceremony, but refused to consult a doctor, although his *r27*wife* vehemently urged him to do so. 
He said to her: "You're always sick, I still like the food".
In the end, however, nothing helped and he was hospitalized, diagnosed with prostate cancer and operated on immediately. Since he couldn't resist tinkering with his catheter, he  got a sepsis and received 8 blood transfusions - but it continued to go downhill with him.
<br><br>When he was back home for a short time, he began to hallucinate, he saw a maharaja and believed that valuable oil stocks were hidden under the bed. His *r13*second daughter* who was pregnant at the time 
was afraid of him.
His *r55*mother-in-law*, who cared for him, fell daown the stairs tot he cellar and broke her femoral neck and so they both ended up in the Lainz hospital, where he died a short time later. He had not lived to see his *r6*second grandchild*.
