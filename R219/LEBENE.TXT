She was married to a *r218*glove maker* who had a shop in Kaerntnerstrasse in +oWIEN+Wien+ (or in Rotenturmstrasse?). He died early and she was alone with 5 children. 
To feed the family, she washed and ironed for "fine gentlemen". Her eldest *r109*daughter* marries the dashing *r108*"Schaani von der Wieden"* at the age of 20,  
the elder *r1915*son* became a master stonemason and moved to +oBERLIN+Berlin+, where his trace is lost, the two girls *r1913*Theresia* and *R1916*Anna* went to the ballet school - 
whereby *r1913*Theresia* even became prima ballerina at the Vienna State Opera and later was very wealthy and the youngest *r1992*son* became city architect with a beautiful villa in +oSALZBUR+Salzburg+ 
right on the river. Fortunately, the children thanked her for these self-sacrificing efforts - in her old age she was taken in by *r1992*Wilhelm* in +oSALZBUR+Salzburg+ in his house - 
while *r1913*Therese* offered her a lifelong pension of 1200 guilders. She gave most of it away to her *r27*great-granddaughter*, who liked to visit her in +oSALZBUR+Salzburg+. 
There she died when the Salzach was flooded, probably in 1909.
