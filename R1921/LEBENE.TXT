After her difficult youth as an orphan in +oBUDAPES+Budapest+ and according to her upbringing with the English ladies, she became a housemaid at a lordship - 
the $s 000$ calodont manufacturer$ Sarg in Vienna. Once, when the cook fell ill, she jumped in and was so skilful that her employers allowed her tob e trained as a cook in the Hotel $s 010$"Golden Lamb"$. This formed the foundation for her further life: she then served with the holders of the $s 020$"Schwaebische Jungfrau"$ 
in +oWIEN+Wien+ on the Hoher Markt and then entered the service of the banker Baron Lieben. When his daughter married the nobleman of Boshan, she moved with them and did not have to regret it.
She also psosessed and played with securities and retired to private life at the age of 42 after a serious operation.
<br><br>Her work consisted of praying, grooming, cutting coupons and playing cards - which she also taught *r27*Alice Koerber*, although she didn't succeed so well to teach her cooking. 
She lived in various places in +oWIEN+Wien+ - also 1st grade in the retirement home in Genzgasse - but she didn't like the food there.
So she finally withdrew to +oDEUTSCH+Deutsch-Wagram+ (first to the Konsumhaus, then to the Lutzky family). As long as she could still walk, she visited  every day her 
relatives in the house, to whom she also bequeathed her entire fortune (she herself never wanted to marry or have children all her life). Unfortunately, their 
Hungarian securities could not be redeemed during the war and became completely worthless.
<br><br>She was a very funny person, but also - in contrast to her *r111*sister* - very pious and went to Holy Mass every day and received communion. 
She was in the Third Order, in whose costume she was also buried in the Koerber grave at the +oDEUTSCH+Deutsch-Wagramer+ cemetery.
