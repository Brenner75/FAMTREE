He spent the first 5 years of his life in +HDEUTSCH+German-Wagram+ in a very female-dominated household together with his *R55*great-grandmother*, *R27*grandmother*, *R13*mother* and 
*R1801*Sister*. *R12*Father* was only there in the evening.
He then attended elementary school in the first district in +HWIEN+Wien+ where the way to school led him directly through $s 000$St.Stephan$. He graduated from the Realgymnasium in Ettenreichgasse in the 10th +HWIEN+Wiener+ district 
in the spring of 1967.
After a year in the Austrian Armed Forces as a $s 010$ reserve officer candidate$, he began studying physics at the University of Vienna, graduating in 1974 with a doctorate. 
<br><br>At that time he was already married to his wife *R7*Franziska*, whom he had met in the Boy Scouts, and also had a two-year-old *R3*daughter* and a 
3 month old *R1806*son*.
<br><br>At the beginning of 1975 the whole family emigrated to England, where they settled in +HPOOLE+Poole+ on the south coast. He worked briefly on an international project at the English Atomic Energy Authority, 
then in HTMP, a team of researchers, and finally started their his own business together with Franziska with a $s 030$ company$ that developed IT programs. The whole family was in the $s 040$Scouts$ 
and would have stayed in England forever if it hadn't been for the great economic crisis at the end of the 80s, which drove his company into bankruptcy. He lost everything they owned 
including $s 050$house$ and $s 060$cars$ and had to leave England with the family as an economic refugee.
Only his *R3*daughter* married *R2*Joe* - whom she had of course met in the scouts - stayed in England and gave him 3 wonderful grandchildren over the years. 
<br><br>He regained a foothold in +HMUENCHE+Muenchen+ at the IBB company, but lost his *R7*wife* a short time later to a serious cancer. In the mid-nineties, after the accidental death of his boss, he took a majority stake in the $s$080 company$ in which he worked and managed it - this time successfully - as managing director until his retirement in 2015.
<br><br>Since then he has been living in a large house in +HWEICHS+Weichs+, has a wonderful weekend relationship with *R2004*Ulrike Goedel*, renovated #OLDTIMER#Oldtimer#, writes computer #MYGAME#games#, undertakes long-distance trips with his 
grandchildren to #AEGYPTEN#Egypt#, #NAMIBIEN#Namibia#, #INDIEN#India# and #ISLAND#Iceland#. A planned trip to the Arctic Circle with *R2033*Ben* could not be made due to the Corona crisis, but there was a short visit to the #LONGAMES#Games Convention# in London. Since 2015, he has been enjoying his '2nd life' in particular, as he had survived a serious colon cancer operation at the time.
