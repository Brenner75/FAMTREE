She was born into a family of $s 000$ transport companies$ who transported pianos and concert grand pianos in +owien+Wien+. Therefore, even after a few years in school, 
a short apprenticeship at the Gerngross company and a job at a health insurance company she stated to work in her parents' $s 010$business$. At first only in the office, but shortly afterwards she acquired the $s 020$truck driver's license$ 
and was in charge of one of the 3 teams. While her workers carried the large $s 03$0piano bodies$, she was allowed to follow with the piano feet.
<br><br>She was a cub leader in the scout group 35, where she also met her future *r6*husband* in 1966. They married 3 years later and she gave birth to her *r3*daughter* in 1970, almost in a truck.
<br><br>Shortly after the birth of her *r1806*son* she followed her husband with the whole family to England, where they settled in +oPOOLE+Poole+, a town on the south coast.
After a few years as a housewife and "nanny", she helped her *r6*husband* start a joint $s 040$IT company$, where she was the finance director. She continued to be involved in the Boy Scouts and was 
Akela in the cub pack of St. Peter's Church. She organized fantastic parties for friends and neighbors with Austrian cuisine in her $s$050 house$ in Wedgwood Drive.
<br><br>In the late 80s, the business failed in the general recession and she had the thankless task of selling all her possessions and handing over the keys to her $s$050 house$ at the bank. 
At that time, her *r6*husband* had already emigrated to Germany as an "economic refugee", where he got a job in +oMUENCHE+Muenchen+. She and her *r1806*son* followed a few months later while her *r3*daughter*
 married the "neighbor boy" *r2*Joe*. 
<br><br>She then lived in the heart +oMUENCHE+Muenchens+ for a few years before she fell seriously ill with lung cancer. She endured her illness with incredible patience and 
died a few days after her 50th birthday in 1997 with her *r6*husband* at her side. She is buried in +oWIEN+Wien+ in the grave of her parents at the Inzersdorf cemetery.
