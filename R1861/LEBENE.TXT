After attending elementary and civil school and graduating from the University of World Trade, he learned the profession of mechanic, went to the railroad and worked at Vienna's Westbahnhof. 
He was involved in the socialist movement at an early age, was active in the trade union and founded the Workers' College in Vienna in 1926 together with Rosa Jochmann. The two were a couple privately for a few years.
<br><br>At the end of the 1920s, he was one of the organizers of the Republican Protection League in Lower Austria. When social democracy was banned in the early 1930s, he went underground. 
In October 1934 he was arrested and sentenced to 10 months in prison in the subsequent Socialist Trial of March 1935, in which the later Federal Chancellor $s 040$Bruno Kreisky$ was also accused. 
In 1939 he was arrested again by the Gestapo and taken to the $BUCHENWALD$Buchenwald$ concentration camp. In 1945 he was liberated by the Red Army. 
<br><br>After the war, he was one of the founding members of the SPOe and also campaigned for the reconstruction of Austria, with his main concern being the nationalization of industry. 
In 1945 he accepted a mandate in the National Council for the SPOe. 
<br><br>Later he ran the Society and Economic Museum with a branch office in the former imperial $s 010$Stadtbahnstation$ of Otto Wagner near Schoenbrunn.
<br><br>He did magic tricks, drove a brisk $s 000$DKW$ with the diplomatic number W122 and wore white shoes with a gray silk suit. He was interested in politics until old age, travelled the world and was the 'colourful bird' of the clan.
He shocked the family by injecting a foam roll into the bosom of his partner (and remote relative) *r1816*Hertha Dorrek* at a family reunion in +oDEUTSCH+Deutsch-Wagram+ and having his carpenter, Mr. Schwinghammer (nomen est omen) convert the chicken coop in the garden into a love nest. 
Even after a leg amputation and severely hampered by Parkinson's disease, he was still interested in the research work of his *r6*nephew* at the English Atomic Energy Authority.
