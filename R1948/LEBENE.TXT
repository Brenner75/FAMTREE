The later privy councillor Smutny was as eccentric and miserly as his parents. He was supposed to be paired up with *r27*Alice*, but she didn't want to know anything about him.
It was all over - when she learned during a visit to his parents' house that he had to sleep with stubble between his fingers to promote his dexterity for playing the piano.
<br><br>He was often invited to the *r55*Binder* family, but did not appreciate the excellent food ("they could also cook me a piece of wood, it would taste the same"), 
nor did he ever bring presents, not even when he was invited to weddings. 
Even as a privy councillor in the state government, he was not above scrounging cigarettes from everyone. 
<br><br>He turned down an invitation to visit his *r27*"childhood friend"* after the war, because he was afraid that the Russians could tear his clothes off his body.
