He learned typesetting and went to the waltz, where he got as far as Paris. He played the zither and played the Marsaillaise in Paris - 
the people were so enthusiastic that they stuffed so many banknotes into his instrument that he could no longer play at all.
He came back to Baden and took over the inn at the Sandwirt from his mother, whom he evicted from the house a short time later.
He married a girl from Prague and took over the restaurant in the Schoepfl Schutzhaus. He shamelessly took advantage of his sister's good-naturedness,
who often had to help in the economy and brought beef filet and cream and was also involved in the preparation in the kitchen.
He and his wife had 2 children, whose names were the same as their parents, namely Josef and Emma.
After her school education and a short stay in Hungary, his niece came to him to help out in the inn. He was able to entertain
his guests with the zither or by imitating the rutting cry of a deer on a lamp cylinder - his niece admired him and followed him and his wife in 1911 to the island of Brioni, where he took over the civil servants' canteen thanks to his brother Hans. 
After that, his trace is lost.
