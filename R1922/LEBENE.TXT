She was a gifted cook and left the family a plethora of $s 000$ recipes$. She must have learned the cooking trade as a young girl in the household of Field Marshal $s 010$Radetzki$.
She sent him doughnuts to +oPARIS+Paris+ and got a nice jar with her name from him as a souvenir. One of Radetzki's mercenaries must have been so in love with her 
that he took one of her little shoes with him to all battles in his tournister.
<br><br>As a souvenir after the death of the Field Marshal in 1858, she took a small $s 020$pancake pan$ with her and moved to +oWIEN+Vienna+. There she entered the service of one of the most famous 
Dancers of the 19th century - Fanny Elssler. Evidently the Field Marshal had given her a good report. She did her shopping in a horse-drawn carriage and had several kitchen helpers.
At the age of 48, however, she voluntarily left this service and was discharged in good health on 31.3.1866 - according to $s 030$ letter from Fanny Elssler$. Then she served a countess Kinsky in Bruenn and lent
money to famous gentlemen such as Charlotte Wolter - a famous actress - who could not return it immediately because of the coming Christmas expenses (see $s 040$Brief$).  
<br><br>She then withdrew to +oWIEN+Wien+ in Nikolsdorfergasse near her *r55*niece*, whose *r26*daughter* she took to school and generally pampered (among other things with a doll's stove 
with 3 spirit flames or Meissen doll dishes!)
<br><br>She kept 3-4 cats and many more bugs, which she pretended not to notice because of her bad eyesight and a lack of specs. With her *r55*niece* she was never allowed to sit on a divan and 
her umbrella was first unbugged and then stretched outside the apartment. 
<br><br>In the old people's home in Genzgasse, she was visited by her *r55*niece* almost every day, even the day before her death, where she pointed out where her  wordly goods and cash was to be found.
When she died the next day, everything was gone. The pious sisters said that this had been used for Holy Masses in the spirit of the deceased.
