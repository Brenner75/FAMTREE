She and her husband were citizens from +oWIEN+Vienna+, certainly well situated, which can be concluded from the jewellery on the couple's $s 010$oil pictures$.
The pictures were painted by the *r2148*brother* of the first *r1949*wife* of her *r216*husband*. 
<br><br>After the birth of two children and after the death of her much older *r218*husband*, she married a second time and gave this *r2149*husband* 3 more children. 
But he must not have been a solid *r2149*man*, because it seems as if she spent her last days as a widow with her *r108*son* in German-Wagram, 
in financial worries. From two jars with Theresientaler, one glass is already missing the thaler, the second already shows traces of etching.
<br><br>At the age of 91, she fell asleep peacefully. At 2 o'clock in the morning she asked for another slice of vanilla, ate half of it and lay dead in bed in the morning.
At their funeral, where only very few people were present, there was such a black ice that the coffin bearers fell over. She is buried in +oDEUTSCH+German-Wagram+ in the old cemetery in Sahulka park opposite the $s 000$Napoleon Memorial Chapel$. After the establishment of the 
new cemetery, most of the bones were exhumed from there and brought to the new cemetery - but not those of Anna Windhager: 
her *r108*son* could not or did not want to pay the expenses for it.
