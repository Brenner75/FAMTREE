She was a milliner and had a paper shop at Wiedner Hauptstrasse 82. She fell in love with the "dashing *r108*Schani* von der Wieden" while he was still married. 
His *r109*wife* was already very ill and one day she was taken out of the ballroom by the *r219*mother-in-law* of the dashing Schani, got a slap in the face and heard: 
"Wait - until she dies!"
After their marriage, however, the fun life for the *r108*Schani* continued, he left her  and he fled to Romania.
<br><br>She had no time for the "noble relatives", and thwarted
hence the ambitions of *r1913*Therese Scholz*, who would have financed an officer's career for her *r54*stepson*. 
With the help of the paper business, she was just able to keep herself and her *r54*stepson* afloat.
Only when her *r198*husband* was brought back by his *r2147*brother-in-law* and accommodated with the imperial Northern Railway, did she
rest in her life and she then led a reasonably good marriage, went to church on Sundays with her *r108*husband* and helped to clean the jewelry every Saturday. She always had a maid, 
until the time when her children moved in with her.
<br><br>She was very domineering and at that time she was already living in Deutsch-Wagram together with her *r54*stepson* and his *r55*wife*, who she treated her like a servant, since she had always been against this marriage.
 To the rebukes of her resolute *r27*granddaughter* she only always replied: 
"Be quiet, you cheeky beak or you'll get a Tetschen (slap in th face)!".
<br><br>After the death of her *r108*husband* she had a Jewish friend who managed to wrest almost the entire inheritance promised to the children from her.
Among them was a double-mantled watch from the Paris World's Fair with an agate set in gold and a brilliant-cut diamond as well as a beautiful table with the finest inlays on the biblical story. 
Only the two $s 000$ancestral images$, the $s 010$grandfather clock$ and the mortgage for the $s 020$house$ remained for her heirs.
