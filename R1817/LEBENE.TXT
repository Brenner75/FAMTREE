At the time of his birth, the family still lived in New York, but then returned to Neustift in Lower Bavaria - probably because 
the father took over the management of the 'Rieger und Seil' quarry. 
He was trained as an electrical engineer and was also supposed to work in the quarry, but this was due to the 2nd World War 
because he was drafted into the military. In 1941 he married Hertha Koerber, who at that time was a refugee and had a job as a teacher.
in Vilshofen. The war marriage did not last long, as a tragic fate befell him in the very last days of the war.
His unit was stationed in Koenigsberg and when a loading crane broke down there, he climbed onto the crane as a trained electrical engineer to repair it.
Unfortunately, soldiers of his own Wehrmacht believed that he was a saboteur and shot him down without further ado.
