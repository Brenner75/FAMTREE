Not much is known about her early life, but after the much too early death of her *r24*husband* (she had already become a widow at the age of 36), who had died just 3 weeks after her *r50*father*, 
she ran a $s 040$dairy shop$ in Capistrangasse in +oWIEN+Wien Mariahilf+ to raise her two sons *r12*Karl* and *r1913*Franz*. She was a very $s 000$proud woman$ and they say 
that she only greeted her customers when they entered her shop, but never when she met them on the street.
She was a stately appearance with interesting green-gray eyes and loved to wear a fox fur in winter, which nestled around her neck and bit her own tail. 
<br><br>Her sister-in-law *r1848*Karoline*, who also lived with her, helped her run the dairy business. Her *r1801*granddaughter* also lived with her, while she lived in the nearby humanistic 
Gymnasium in Rahlgasse and thus saved the long way to school from +oDEUTSCH+German-Wagram+. The apartment (in which an original $s 010$rocking chair$ of the Viennese company Thonet stood -which is still in use today in the family by her *r6*grandson*) was located on the ground floor with a beautiful view of a courtyard where from time to time you can hear the vocal exercises of the 
Burgschauspielers $s 020$Josef Meinrad$, who also lived there.
<br><br>She regularly burned her little moustache with a candle before she met a Mr. Brillinger, who was probably a kind of partner of hers in the later years, but hardly ever 
appeared and was very restrained.
<br><br>In her old age she was severely diabetic and got an open wound on her leg that did not want to heal and ultimately led to her $s 030$death$.
