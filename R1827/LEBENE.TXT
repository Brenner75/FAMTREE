He had always skived school and was led back to class by his sister.
He joined the military in Laxenburg and deserted there as well. He hid with his sister under the pretext that he did not have to return to the barracks because of an abscess on his neck. He was then arrested early in the morning by the military police from the apartment in Davidgasse. He was transferred from the tanks to the infantry with the 9th Army in Stalingrad, from where he never returned.
