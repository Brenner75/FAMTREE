She belonged to the generation that had to suffer 2 world wars and had to suffer a lot of hardship accordingly.
She was born in the Gasthaus zum Sandwirt in +oBADEN+Baden+ and was an enfent terrible as a child, but was very spoiled by all relatives, especially by *R1922*Fanny* aunt. 
*r55*Mother* was totally inconsistent in her upbringing.
As a child, she went for a walk with her parents and the Dorrek family on the Linienwall in +oWIEN+Wien+ (today's Guertel) and was drilled by the *r54*father*.
She went to school in Vienna for a year and a half, she often spent holidays in +oSALZBUR+Salzburg+ with the *r219*great-grandmother* in the house of the chief building officer *r1992*Scholz* in the #s000#Buergelsteinstrasse#  
with a large park on the Salzach with gymnastic frames, rings and swings.
She once got stuck in a tree while swinging and had to be freed by the gardener, stuck beans in her nose that had to be removed by the doctor or almost drowned in the water of her *r1992*uncle*
 built indoor pool, so that her *r1993*aunt* fainted right away.
<br><br>Finally, in 1901, she was sent by her *r54*father* to the boarding school of the #s020#Englischen Fraeulein# in St. Poelten to learn languages and piano playing.
She passed the entrance exam so well that she immediately skipped a grade. Unfortunately, however, she was a sick child, already had pneumonia, measles and scarlet fever as a schoolchild. 
The first time at boarding school was hard - on the first day of her visit she called out to her *r54*father* - who had cleverly come alone: "Please dear father, take me home, here I have to die!" 
But after 2 weeks everything turned out well and she spent the most beautiful years of her life in boarding school until 1906 with tennis games, theater performances, decency courses and dance events.
<br><br>After school, her *r1911*uncle* brought her to +omartonv+Martonvasar+ in Hungary as a babysitter, as his *r1905*wife* was seriously ill with lung disease after the birth of the 5th boy. 
*r1911*Uncle* was stable master for Eugen Dreher, who had 80 riding horses and 10 carriages. Instead of supervising the newborn, however, she took the carriage for a walk in the castle park.
After several months she returned to +oDEUTSCH+German-Wagram+ (which is why she was thought to be a blonde gypsy), where she met her future *r26*husband* for the first time at a dance party in Strasshof. 
<br><br>+oDEUTSCH+Wagram+ was too monotonous for her, so she began to help out with her *r1904*uncle* in the #s010#Schoepfl shelter#. The work there was hard, but she managed to get 3 older gentlemen of a hunting party 
sanded 200 pieces of cutlery for them, while she sang to them for it! 
<br><br>1911 she moved with her *r1904*uncle* to the island of +oBRIONI+Brioni+ (a meeting place of the European Nobility - #BRIONI#here# a rare movie clip taken just before the outbreak of the first 
world war), where she helped out in his restaurant.
She was revered by many gentlemen (even in Trieste they spoke of the new blond girl on Brioni), including a tall, slender black-haired architect who had dazzling teeth 
and almost became her fate (according to her own statements, however, she was still naiv and unkissed at that time).
When she learned that he had a child with a parlor maid, she rebuffed him. 
<br><br>After some confusion and misunderstandings, she finally married *r26*Emil*, who was a teacher in Neusiedl at the time. The first years of their marriage were terrible, as two fundamentally different worlds collided, 
Alice, who was educated and knew how to move in the best company, and *r26*Emil* who spent most of her time in the inn.
Due to several terrible events (a near accident with a hay wagon and a violent quarrel between workers in front of her house) she was so traumatized that during the first pregnancy she was 
could no longer walk and talk and also had an epileptic seizure. She was afraid her *r1816*child* would be born mute.
When the time finally came, she gave birth to a *r1816*girl* (who was not mute!) and a heaped indefinable bloody mass who had probably been a twin child.
Fortunately, her *r26*husband* began to concentrate more on her care during a sick breastfeeding phase and sat around in pubs far less.
In 1916 she was pregnant again, her *r26*husband* was in the military and she lived with her parents because there was nothing left to eat in Neusiedl and the farmers were very envious.
She never forgot that, many years after the war she sometimes went shopping and came through the farmers' market where all the goods were loudly offered for sale. She then said to a particularly intrusive market woman: 
"You didn't give anything away in the war, you can eat it yourself now!"
<br><br>Shortly before giving birth, she had a serious accident at home. To prevent a burning candle from starting a conflagration, she dislocated herself so unhappily that she skied out her shoulders. 
Since it took 8 hours for a doctor to arrive, the damage was so great that she could not lift her arms for 12 years, which of course was a severe disability and almost drove her to suicide. 
Her husband was now a great help and soon learned to adjust her shoulders himself, which saved a lot of medical costs.
<br><br>There was great hunger, for 3 adults and 2 children there was only half a kilo of meat a week, half of which were bones.  
Her *r26*husband* leased a field in Strasshof and planted beans, potatoes and kukuruz there. With the *r13*baby* in the cart, she tilled the field with her maid Mizzi Schibl and her *r26*husband* 
so that the harvest could be stolen promptly!
Only a little corn was left to feed the geese from Poland and to feed 2 chickens. At home, winter clothes were worn because there was hardly any coal left.
<br><br>1918 the war was over and in 1919 she and her family moved to +oADERKLA+Aderklaa+ where their *r26*husband* finally got a permanent job as a teacher. In contrast to Neusiedl, they were in +oADERKLA+Aderklaa+
 very welcome and were welcomed by everyone. It helped that she had imposed a ban on her *r26*husband* from the pub (which he also kept), so that he would not have to deal with the mayor or other 
regulars - which was probably the order of the day there.
She herself was involved in youth work, rehearsed #s040#gang shows#, helped out with the boys' club and embellished her apartment. For 25 years she spent a harmonious time, 
their marriage had also improved considerably. The time of need was over, as *r26*Emil* had plenty to do as an organ player, teacher, community secretary and insurance agent and earned well.
Her third pregnancy in 1925 had to be terminated for health reasons. During the anesthesia she must have talked so much nonsense that the doctors laughed themselves half to death 
and she swore never to be anesthetized again, which she did several years later with a hernia operation in the lower abdomen and underwent it under local anesthesia! 
in general, she was very often ill and had 12 hospital stays in her life.
<br><br>1942 the school in +oADERKLA+Aderklaa+ was closed due to lack of children, in 1944 their *r54*father* died and therefore they moved to the *r55*mother* in +oDEUTSCH+Wagram+. In 1945, her *r26*man* was drafted into the Volkssturm.
They kept their heads above water with labour-intensive rabbit and chicken breeding and unsuccessful beekeeping. All bees died from mites, they had cost over 3 million Reichsmarks.
Alice signed up for the hospital service, the Russian liberators had marched in and she decided to take Russian officers into her house. She was very lucky with a few, unlucky with others. 
The latter found all the buried valuables or shot drunkenly through the front door and threatened her and her family with death because a former student had hidden them from them in the shed. 
who would have liked to rape her.
<br><br>Great joy in 1946 when her *r13*daughter* and her *r1801*grandchild* had returned home from fleeing Bavaria and her *r12*son-in-law* had also been released from Russian captivity.
The deputy local commander quartered with her, a Ukrainian named Theodor, was a loving enemy who took great care of the whole family and even cared for them. Your *r1801*granddaughter*
 - a bad eater in - he always admonished: "Herthi you don't memmeln!"
<br><br>The whole family was emaciated and starved to death, but especially *r26*Emil* whom his colleagues no longer recognized at a high school graduation meeting. 
During his care, her *r55*mother* had also broken her femoral neck. 
<br><br>These were black times. Her son-in-law *r12*Karl* had to undergo a serious stomach operation, *r1817*Schorsch*
 her second son-in-law was shot in Koenigsberg, *r26*Emil* did not get a pension because he was considered "incriminated". He was also seriously ill with prostate cancer and died miserably and in delirium a short time later.
<br><br>After the birth of her second *r6*grandchild*, she continued to live in +oDEUTSCH+Wagram+ in the association of a large family (*r13*daughter*, *r12*son-in-law* and 2 grandchildren). After the death of her *r55*mother* and the relocation of the 
After the Brenner family to Vienna, she lived alone in the house from 1955 onwards, which over the years developed into the central meeting place for the whole family on weekends. In 1965 she fell seriously ill again, but lived - 
to her own surprise, another 6 years, the last of them in a retirement home in +oWIEN+Wien+.
