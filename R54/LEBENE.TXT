Since his *r109*mother* had died at an early age, he had a difficult childhood under the care of his evil *r1982*stepmother*. But then he was mainly looked after by his 
*r1913*Aunt* Theresia Scholz, who was a State Opera dancer.
She wanted to finance his career as an officer, but this was thwarted by his *r1982*stepmother* because she did not like the "noble relatives".
<br><br>During his military service in Baden, he met his future wife *r55*Emilie* in the inn and later married her against strong competition from his student friends. 
Since he had a good figure, he was once asked by his superior colonel if he wore a bodice. He was so excited about this that he pulled out his $s 000$saber$ and 
almost came before a court-martial. Thankfully, however, this episode had no further consequences.
<br><br>As a child he had smallpox and lay blind in bed for 7 days and therefore bore many scars, but his *r55*wife* didn't mind that ("nice patching is also beautiful").
<br><br>Since his parents wanted to thwart the marriage with *r55*Emilie*, he broke with them - he was supposed to marry a daughter of the landlord of Moedlingen. 
They did not appear at his wedding. It was only at the baptism of his *r27*daughter* that there was a kind of reconciliation. However, his *r55*wife* was treted by her *r1982*step-in-law* 
but like a servant.
<br><br>After the death of his *r1913*aunt*, he inherited 5000 guilders and thus added a room and a veranda to the $s$040 house$ in Deutscg-Wagram, which his parents had acquired shortly before. 
He inherited again from his *r217*grandmother* and expanded the $s 040$house$ in 1904 by three more rooms to its present state. He was one of the first to use electric light 
and had a water pipe introduced, and bright chandeliers burned in all the rooms. 
<br><br>With his beautiful bass voice he was a member of the $s 020$Gesangsverein$ in Deutsch-Wagram and sang with his childhood friend *r1955*Karl Dorrek* and the gentlemen Schwetter and 
Strasser in the $s 010$Vernay$ Quartet. They gave many guest performances and traveled to the $s 030$Turkey$.
On the island of Brioni, he once helped a lady to find a piece of jewellery that had fallen into the water on the quay. He dived so long that one thought 
he would never come up again. But he found the jewellery and was thus the hero of the day.
<br><br>In raising his only *r27*daughter* he was rigorous and set up the following timetable for her: In the morning you have to operate the duster and the wooden spoon, 
after the meal it is time to wash dishes and then 2 hours are yours,
you can read, write letters, visit friends or whatever makes you happy, then you learn to mend, knit, darn, do you need it yourself, is it good for you, 
if you have servants, you must know better than they do, or you will be sold. 
<br><br>His grandchildren *r13*Alice* and *r1816*Hertha* grew up with him and his *r55*wife* and were brought up in the same way - especially to be punctual. Even if they were only late by one minute , he was already at the door with the $s 070$pocket watch$. One day they wanted to run away because of the strict upbringing and the whole family cried, he only said: 
"Let the stupid children go!". 
<br><br>He was a member of the municipal council, the association for the construction of the Deutsch-Wagram $s 060$ War Memorial$ and significantly involved in the construction of the $s 050$ lido$.
<br><br>Two days before his death, his *r27*daughter* was still with him and fed him pineapple strawberries. He stroked her hair and said, "You were a good child 
and you've always given me nothing but joy. Due to a persistent air raid alarm, she was unable to visit him afterwards.
